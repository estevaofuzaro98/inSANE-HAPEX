Final work developed for the course Uncertainty Quantification of the Graduate Program in Mechanical Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering of Ilha Solteira (FEIS/UNESP).

**Theme:** Global [S]ensitivity [AN]alysis of an [E]nergy [HA]rvesting System with [P]eriodic [EX]citation via Sobol Indices

# Documentation
**inSANE_HAPEX** modules are commented to facilitate the usage by the users.

# Software History
This suite is an ensemble of codes developed to conduct a global sensitivity analysis on an multimodal energy harvesting system with periodic excitation.

The underlying results are reported in the publication presented on **publications** folder.

# Reproducibility
Simulations done with **inSANE_HAPEX** are fully reproducible, considering that you have **UQLab** modules installed.
